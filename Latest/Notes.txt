Personal Notes:
===============

230819: The code is Ep7 is complicated/less pleasing.
        Instead of veriying for checks/pins why not simply generating the list
        and then removing those that result in the king being in check.
        This is more efficient than the initial "Naive" method.
        Not sure that it is less efficient that the propose "Complicated" method.
        
        PseudoCode
        ==========
        1) moves = GetAllPossibleMoves()
        2) save the GameState
        3) for each move in moves:
        4)      try the move
        5)      if the king is in Check then:
        6)              remove the move from moves
        7)      reset the GameState
        
        This seems much simpler. 
        Perhaps even faster as it simplifies all move generation code.

        I will not implement it until the end of the series to stay current with his code.
